## JS Pagination Project

This repo contains a single JavaScript page application that displays a list of students. It includes both pagination an search functionality.

This project required DOM manipulation, writing functions, and breaking large tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. It also requires code comments (which, BTW, I am always worried I write WAY too many of, so if that's the case, please feel free to say so :D) I also QA tested it in Chrome, Safari and Firefox (I don't have a PC or I would have done Edge as well).

In addition to the main project, I also added search functionality, search pagination, and a reset button for users to return the listing to its default state after a search.
